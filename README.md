# Warehouse Wreckage

This game was developed with Unreal Engine 5 and was created with guidance from Udemy Unreal Engine 5 C++ Course.

## Gameplay 
The game takes place inside a building loaded with construction-like objects. The object of the game is to knock over as many of the objects (racks, cones, etc.)
as possible before your ammunition (cannonballs) runs out. When your ammunition does run out, the level will restart for you.

## Source Control
Unreal Engine 5 wasn't able to connect to Git as a result of an "out of video memory" error. Had to clone all the files onto local repo and push them manually.
